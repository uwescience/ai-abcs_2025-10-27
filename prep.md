# How to prepare for this workshop

## Hardware and Software Requirements

The course requires a laptop (not a tablet or chromebook), and you must have
the following pieces of software installed on it.
* **Docker**. Docker is a virtual machine tool that is used in the
  workshop. Installation instructions for all major operating systems can be
  found [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).
* **A Unix Shell/Terminal**. Window's command prompt/`CMD.EXE` will not
  suffice. See [these instructions](
  https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell)
  for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* **Git**. See [these instructions](
  https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git)
  for Windows, Mac, and Linux.


## Skill Required

Primarily, you must be comfortable with basic Python. Advanced knowledge is not
required, but at a minimum students should be comfortable with Python syntax
and familiar with the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library and the
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library.

If you are comfortable with Python but are not familiar with NumPy and Pandas,
then the [Programming with Python](
https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation) and [Plotting and
Programming with Python](
https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) lessons are good
introductions to NumPy and Pandas, respectively, from the ground up (i.e., very
little Python knowledge is assumed). For a more advanced tutorial, we recommend
the [Python Data Science Handbook](
https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).

If you are just starting out with Python, then we recommend the Software
Carpentry lessons linked above.

The course also uses a small amount of
[git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) to coordinate the
lessons. Familiarity with these tools isn't critical to the lesson, but the
[Software Carpentry lesson on git]( https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice)
and the [Software Carpentry Incubator Lesson on Docker](
https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/docker-introduction/) are good places
to start if you are interested in learning more about them.
